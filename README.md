# Event-Manager
Event Management Platform: Users create, discover, and manage events based on location. Register, log in, create profiles, specify event details, set visibility preferences, browse events, RSVP, and communicate with organizers and attendees.


Steps:

1 User uploads event. (this may be changed for an API that provides the event).

Other users can see the list of the event.

Users can comment on the event to ask information.

Users can confirm assistance to the events, with a button.

A list will the updated with the users that confirm assistance.

Optional

Events will be confirmed 48 hours earlier, depending on the assistance number. Otherwise it will be canceled and users will be told.

For example. My party only had 2 of the 5 assistance confirmations, so it gets canceled. Notifying the users
